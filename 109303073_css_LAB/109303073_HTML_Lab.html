        <h2>Why Are Cats So Cute? What the Science Says</h2>
          <p>Cats are sooo cute..</p>
          <p>Like babies, cats seem to activate our brain’s cuteness response. This might be due to cats’ physical characteristics, including child-like features like big eyes and small noses. Studies have shown that humans, particularly women, extend the “baby schema effect” to animals as well as babies. </p>
          <p>Another phenomenon associated with cuteness, so-called “cute aggression,” pertains to both young humans and young animals.
          A perplexing response from a brain overwhelmed by positive emotions, cute aggression is defined as the urge to bite or squeeze extremely adorable things, without the intent of causing harm. In a recent study, researchers at the University of California found that human babies and baby animals activated similar parts of the brain when triggering participants’ “cute aggression.”

        <h2>Ways to Capture Your Cat’s Cuteness</h2>
          <p>Create a paw-print keepsake. From wall art to ceramics to jewelry, there are many ways to creatively display your cat’s unique “signature.” Just be sure to use pet-safe ink and/or clay when taking their paw-prints! (If you’re not crafty yourself, a number of Etsy shops create personalized paw art.)
          <p>Commission a pet portrait. Photographs are great, but a painted portrait lends a certain gravitas that your little lion would surely appreciate. (If you don’t have a local artist in mind, there are plenty of pet portrait artists on Etsy and Instagram.) </p>
          <p>Start a #kittygram. Does the Internet need more vacation photos? No. Does it need more cute cat photos? Always. Start a social media account and share your cat’s adorable little face with the whole world – we’ll be following!
